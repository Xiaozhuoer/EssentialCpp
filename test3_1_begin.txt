Four short words sum up what has lifted most successful individuals above the crowd: a little bit more
All things in their being are good for something
Difficult circumstances serve as a textbook of life for people
Failure is the mother of success
For man is man and master of his fate
The unexamined life is not worth living
None is of freedom or of life deserving unless he daily conquers it anew
Our destiny offers not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity. So let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness
Living without an aim is like sailing without a compass
What makes life dreary is the want of motive
Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored
There is no such thing as a great talent without great will
